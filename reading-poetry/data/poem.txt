The Cloak of Solitude

I walk alone, yet I am not apart,
A desert blooms within my heart.
The world sees laughter, the world sees cheer,
But silence whispers what none can hear.

I drink from the cup of solitude's stream,
A quiet joy, a sacred dream.
Yet, in the crowd, I play my part,
A mask of mirth to shield my heart.

Oh, to be unseen, to melt like air,
To walk unseen, and leave no care.
But the soul, a bird, cannot stay confined,
It seeks the sky, the vast, the divine.
